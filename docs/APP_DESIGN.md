# Mytekkstore Online Store — App Design

The visual rules for every page. Layout follows the recommended reference, Croma: bold and image led. The colour theme is white, as requested by the client.

## 1. Design principles

1. **Images do the selling.** Large banners and clean product photos on every screen.
2. **Clean and white.** A white page with light grey bands keeps attention on product photos. Hero and promo banners stay dark for contrast.
3. **One accent colour.** It is used only for actions and prices that matter.
4. **Dense but tidy.** Many products per screen, like a real retail store, with clear spacing.
5. **Phone first.** Every block is designed for a phone and then widened for desktop.

## 2. Colours

| Use | Colour | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Page background | `#f4f5f7` | |
| Header and footer | `#ffffff` | |
| Cards | `#ffffff` | With a light border |
| Lines and borders | `#e2e5ea` | |
| Main text | `#15181e` | |
| Secondary text | `#6b7280` | |
| Body copy | `#3f4652` | CSS variable --soft |
| Text on accent | `#ffffff` | CSS variable --on: buttons and badges |
| Accent | `#08805f` | Placeholder. Replace with Mytekkstore's brand colour **[CONFIRM]** |
| Product photo background | `#ffffff` | White tiles so real product photos look consistent |

## 5. Components

| Component | Design |
|---|---|
| Header | Sticky, frosted white. Offer ticker, logo, search box with live suggestions (products with photo and price, categories, brands; the biggest deals before typing), "Deliver to" pincode chip, country selector, account, wishlist and cart with counts |
| Category bar | Light strip under the header: Televisions, Washing Machines, Air Conditioners, Brands, Deals. The name itself is the control; there are no arrow buttons. Scrolls sideways on phones |
| Category menu | Opens under the bar when a name is hovered (desktop), tapped once (phone) or reached with Tab. Size or capacity tiles and brand tiles, four popular models, a Discover list, and a promo card for the TV size guide. The page behind is dimmed |
| Explore tiles | Sideways-scrolling tiles at the top of a category page (TVs by Size, each brand, 4K Ultra HD, Google TV, the other categories) that wrap on desktop and swipe on phones (no scroll line or arrow buttons: the client rejected them); size tabs below |
| Top features | Dark green band with six line-icon tiles per category and the category's room clip playing faintly behind them |
| TV size guide | White card on the Televisions page only: viewing-distance slider, drawing of sofa and screen, recommended size, Shop button and a size table |
| Hero slider | Full-width cinematic banners, 3 slides (TV, washing machines, AC), slow zoom with the aurora light, auto-rotating every 5 seconds with a filling progress bar per slide, arrows, two pill buttons per slide (Shop now, See deals), and a floating glass "spotlight" card at the bottom right with that category's best deal (photo, name, price, discount). Stock video was tried here and dropped: the clips looked cheap next to the banners |
| Numbers band | Four white cards under the hero with a figure that counts up when they scroll in: biggest discount, 9 months No Cost EMI, number of bank offers, 100% genuine. Every figure comes from the catalogue or the bank offer list, never typed in |
| Bento grid | "Built for your home": a 4-column dark grid, one big photo tile (TVs) and one small tile per other category, each with the first two Top features of that category (so the copy only claims what the specifications support), plus a wide green glass tile with the lowest No Cost EMI per month |
| Shop by size row | White card per category: category name with "by size" or "by capacity", one price chip per size on sale (the product page's size swatch style) linking to that size's filtered list, and on Televisions a "Not sure?" link to the size guide |
| Customer quote | White card: star row, the review text in quotes, the reviewer's name and the product; the whole card links to the product. Lifts on hover like the trust tiles |
| Good to know | Native details/summary cards with a plus that turns into a minus when open; the open card gets the accent border. Answers are plain text with at most one link |
| Specifications groups | The product's specification rows grouped under uppercase headings (General, Display, Sound, Smart features, Connectivity, Performance, Warranty) picked by the specification's name; empty groups are left out |
| Category block | One per category, the Samsung home-page pattern: a lifestyle banner (dark gradient on the left, category, "Explore by size" headline, from-price, biggest discount, model count, white pill button) and four product cards under it |
| Category tile | Three full-width tiles on the home page: the category's lifestyle photo fills the tile, a dark gradient at the bottom carries the name, model count and "from ₹…" price, "Shop now →" appears on hover, and the product photo floats top-right as a small tilted white card. Stacked one per row on phones |
| Product gallery | Big zoomable photo, thumbnail strip when more photos exist, and a feature strip of up to six specifications with line icons below it (like the reference product page) |
| Product sub-nav | Desktop only, Samsung style: once Add to cart scrolls away, a bar slides in under the header with the product name, Overview / Specs / Compare / Reviews (the one in view is underlined), the price and Add to cart |
| Category banner | The "Explore … by Size" headline sits on a lifestyle photo (living room, laundry, bedroom) with a dark gradient and a slow parallax as you scroll |
| Buttons and search | Pill shaped (fully rounded), like Samsung's |
| Brand card | Large gradient card with the brand name, product count and "Explore →" (logos to come from the client) |
| Product card | Photo on white, brand, 2-line name, price, struck-through MRP, "Save ₹x" pill, discount badge, No Cost EMI tag, "Free delivery · get it by <date>" line, Add to cart |
| Deal badge | Small red-orange gradient label on the photo corner, for example "34% off" |
| Wide banner | One dark wide banner that opens the Offers page |
| Bank offer card | White card with a coloured bank wordmark (real logos to come from the client), the headline offer, one line of terms and "T&C apply"; a light sweeps across it on hover |
| No Cost EMI tag | Small mint label under the price on cards and product pages, shown only on products with the EMI flag set in the admin |
| Icons | One SVG line-icon set (24 px grid, 1.8 px rounded stroke) everywhere: offer ticker, header, perks, Top features, feature strip, trust strip, compare table. No emoji anywhere, so icons look the same on every phone and computer |
| Add-on box | "Complete your home" on every product page, like the reference's accessories box: this product plus one ticked product from each other category (same brand first), a live total and one "Add all to cart" button |
| Compare table | On every product page: this product (tinted, "This product" chip) beside up to three similar models in photo columns; rows for price (with a "Lowest price" chip), rating, each specification, No Cost EMI and Add to cart. Rows where the models differ carry a green dot and bold values. Scrolls sideways on phones |
| Sign-in card | Two columns: a dark photo panel with three benefits on the left, a white card on the right with the Google button (when set up), a Mobile number / Email tab bar and the forms. The code field is large and spaced |
| Trust strip | Four tiles with self-drawing line icons: delivery, genuine products, cash on delivery, order tracking |
| Filters | Faceted sidebar on desktop (brand, price band, discount, in stock, No Cost EMI, 4★ and above, each with a count); a bottom sheet behind a "Filters (n)" pill on phones; applied filters as green chips with ×; sort in a pill select above the grid |
| Phone bottom bar | Fixed, frosted bar on phones: Home, Shop, Deals, Cart (with count), Account; the current one is green |
| EMI plans | "View EMI plans" under the per-month line opens a small 3 / 6 / 9 month table (a native details element, no script) |
| Deliver to | Pill chip in the header with a pin icon, "Deliver to" and the district and pincode; opens a small pop-over with the pincode field |
| Buttons | Primary: green gradient fill with white text. Secondary: outline |
| Footer | Trust row (no card details stored, cash on delivery, easy returns, brand warranty, free delivery) over four link columns and copyright. Contact details, social icons and payment icons wait for the client |

## 7b. Premium pass (2026-10-09)

The client asked for an Apple-like feel. One block at the end of `web/src/style.css` (marked "Premium pass") raises the whole scale: 16px body copy, section headlines of 30 to 46px with tight letter-spacing and a sub-line (`.lead`) under every home headline, 64 to 120px of air between sections, pill buttons (999px), cards and tiles at 22 to 28px radius, a hero up to 620px tall with a 76px headline, bigger numbers band, size chips, quotes, offers and FAQ rows. The sub-lines in `home.jsx` only describe what the data under them shows. Section and card reveals rise 10px (was 16 and 14) so they feel calm; the browser test helper waits 250 ms after scrolling for that motion to settle.

### Category pages (2026-10-09)

The client found a category with two products "boring" (reference: palmo.co.in, a brand site that tells a story under the product grid). Every category page now continues after the grid with: **Compare the models** (up to four products side by side: price, rating, each specification, No Cost EMI, add to cart, computed from the catalogue), the **Top features** band, **Know before you buy** (four explainer cards per category from `CAT_KNOW` in `data.js`: general, factual copy; nothing about a specific model), the TV size guide (TVs only), a **deals banner** (biggest discount, model count and lowest price from the catalogue), **What customers say** (newest reviews in that category), **Bank offers**, and **Good to know** (four questions per category from `CAT_FAQ`). Brand, search and wishlist lists keep the plain grid. When real products arrive, re-read `CAT_KNOW` and `CAT_FAQ` once; the numbers there (room sizes, capacities, viewing distance) are general guidance, not model claims.

### Studio theme (2026-10-09)

The client still found the site "not premium" after the type and spacing pass. The gap was the visual language: grey background, white boxes with 1px borders, a scrolling green ticker, a big grey search bar, orange discount badges and delivery lines on every card are marketplace vocabulary (Flipkart, Croma). Brand sites (Apple, Samsung, palmo.co.in) use one quiet palette, almost no borders, photos on soft tiles, black or white pill buttons and a display typeface. The "Studio theme" block at the end of `web/src/style.css` makes that switch: warm paper background `#f5f4f0`, ink-black pill buttons (`--ink`; green stays the accent for links, prices and active states; set `--ink` to `var(--accent)` to return to green buttons), Manrope 800 headlines (linked with Inter in `web/shells.js`), no ticker, search and country as soft pills, borderless cards with the product photo multiplied onto a `#f1efe9` tile, ink discount pills, no delivery line on cards, numbers band without boxes, borderless size chips, explainer cards, quotes and offers, divider-style FAQ, dark footer. The hero buttons are white pills on the photo. Note: the green gradient button rule uses `.btn:not(.ghost):not([disabled])`, so any button restyle must be written at that specificity.

What code cannot add, and the client must supply for the last stretch of "premium": real product photography and lifestyle shots, the brand logo and colour, short product videos, real reviews and real bank terms.

### Cinematic pass (2026-10-09)

The client wanted the pages to feel "crazy, creative, premium" with images and video. The "Cinematic pass" block at the end of `web/src/style.css` and `reveal()` in `web/src/motion.js` add: a full-bleed hero (edge to edge, text aligned with the page column), every section headline rising word by word (`riseWords`, the words are wrapped once in one flex item so "View all" stays right), the tiles inside a revealed section arriving one after another (`TILES` in motion.js; the CSS staggers for `.kcat`, `.bt` and `.offer` were switched off), the free Pexels room clips playing behind the three category stories on the home page and behind each category page opener (`video.bvid`, loaded and played only in view by `lazyClips`, never under reduced motion or data saver), photos that unmask as they scroll in (CSS scroll-driven `clip-path`, browsers without it just show them), a big-type marquee of the categories and brands after the numbers band, and an "In focus" story: the biggest deal with a full specification list sits in a sticky white tile while its specifications scroll past one at a time (`.story`, `.focusimg`, `.step`; stacked on phones). Buttons went back to the brand green after a round with ink-black ones: the logo is green, and one colour for actions with black for structure reads as one brand. A section the address points at (`#features`, `#guide`, `#compare`) only fades, so the deep-link scroll lands exactly on it. Class names to avoid: `.spin` is the loading spinner.

Client decision 2026-10-09: the "Shop by size" rows are off the home page (the size chips stay on the category pages, in the menus and in the TV size guide). A "calmer sizes" block at the end of the stylesheet caps the hero, headlines, marquee and numbers one step smaller than the first cinematic cut.

### Info pages (2026-10-09)

The client found the site "empty on some pages": About, Contact, Store locator, Shipping, Returns, Terms and Privacy were one placeholder paragraph each. `web/src/info.jsx` now renders each as a full page in the store's language: the category opener with its room clip, then (About) a live numbers band, the category tiles, the two brands, the four promises and the FAQ; (Contact) a working form that lands in the admin outbox plus "ways to reach us" cards (phone, email and address appear once `CONTACT` in `data.js` is filled); (Store locator) store cards from `STORES`, the pincode delivery check and the category tiles; (Shipping) the promises, the pincode check and a numbered policy; (Returns) three steps and a numbered policy; (Terms, Privacy) numbered plain-words policies written from how the site really works (prices checked on the server, no card details stored, one sign-in cookie, no tracking). Every page ends with the festive-offers banner. The empty cart and the 404 page show the Deals of the Day. The policy figures are in `POLICY` (draft: 7-day returns, 7 working-day refunds) for the client to confirm.

## 8. Motion

Everything here switches off when the device asks for reduced motion.

Since 2026-10-06 the storefront's motion runs on **Motion** (motion.dev, the `motion` package, React 19): the hero parts and headline words rise on springs with a stagger (variants in `web/src/home.jsx`), sections fade and rise as they scroll in and the numbers count up through Motion's `inView` and `animate` (`web/src/motion.js`), the cart drawer slides on a spring, the toast pops in and out with `AnimatePresence`, the top progress line is a sprung scroll value (`Chrome` in `web/src/components.jsx`), the add-to-cart photo flies with `animate`, product cards rise in one after another as they scroll into view and tilt toward the pointer on springs (`Card`), the wishlist heart pops, the category menu panels fade down with their tiles arriving one after another (`flyIn`), the product gallery cross-fades between photos and the markers on the product sub-nav pills and tab bar slide between tabs (`layoutId`), and the applied-filter chips pop in and out (`AnimatePresence` in `category.jsx`). `MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"` in `main.jsx` makes every Motion animation honour the visitor's setting. Hover tilts, Ken Burns zooms, glows and the scroll-driven parallax stay in CSS. The components are the `m.*` kind inside `LazyMotion`, and the feature pack (`web/src/motion-features.js`, domMax) arrives in its own 19 KB file right after the page script, so the first script is about 135 KB gzipped instead of 152 KB. Load-time measures of 2026-10-06: the three startup API calls go out together, the Inter font is linked from the HTML head (not a CSS @import), and the home shell preloads the first hero photo.

### 8.1 What moves today

- Hero: slides fade every 5 seconds and pause on hover, with a progress bar that fills under the active slide; the headline rises word by word; the picture zooms slowly and drifts toward the pointer (parallax); a soft aurora light drifts over it; the headline shimmers; the spotlight card floats gently; the whole banner shrinks a little as you scroll past it. Video is used only in the Top features bands, where it sits faintly behind the tiles.
- Numbers band: each figure counts up from 0 over 1.4 seconds the first time it scrolls into view (shown at once when the visitor prefers reduced motion).
- Bento and category banners: photos move slower than the page (CSS scroll-driven animation, no JavaScript, in browsers that support it) and zoom on hover; tiles enter one after another; the arrow link slides right on hover; the glass tiles carry a drifting glow.
- Product cards show a "Save ₹…" pill next to the struck-out MRP.
- Sections fade up as they scroll into view; cards enter one after another; headings draw their underline.
- Product cards tilt in 3D toward the pointer, with a soft light that follows it; the photo zooms slightly; the heart appears; the discount badge pulses.
- Add to cart: the photo flies to the cart icon, the count bumps, and the button turns into a quantity stepper.
- Category tiles: the clip zooms slowly and the product card straightens on hover; "Shop now" slides in. Scroll arrows on product rows show only when the row really overflows.
- Brand cards: slow moving gradient. The wide offer banner and the Top features band have a glowing light that drifts and moves at a different speed to the page (parallax).
- Why Mytekkstore: line icons draw themselves when the section appears and fill green on hover (no emoji).
- Offers page: sparks rise behind the festive headline, which shimmers; category offer tiles lift and tilt their picture on hover; bank offer cards enter one after another and get a light sweep on hover.
- Order placed: a short confetti burst over the green tick.
- Top features band: the category's room clip fades in behind the tiles when the band scrolls into view.
- Category banner: the photo moves slower than the page (parallax); eyebrow, headline and line rise in one after another.
- Product sub-nav: slides down under the header; the underline moves to the section in view.
- Product page: the stock bar fills on load, the delivery dot pulses, the buy bar slides up, thumbnails lift on hover.
- Not done on purpose: a header that shrinks on scroll (it would jump the page content by the ticker's height).
- Motion reference: samsung.com, for feel only (reveals, pill controls, sticky product sub-nav, parallax banners), never for content.
- Sign-in page: the photo panel zooms slowly.
- Search suggestions and the Deliver-to pop-over rise in; the filter sheet slides up on phones and the page behind dims; filter chips fill green on hover.
- Category menus fade in under the bar and the page behind dims.
- Offer ticker scrolls across the top and pauses on hover. Scroll progress bar at the top, back-to-top button after 300 px. Toasts slide up. Skeleton shimmer while loading.
- Not used on purpose: scroll lines with arrow buttons under tile rows (client decision, 2026-10-04); page-to-page view transitions (they throw console errors when a link opens a non-HTML file such as the sitemap, tried twice, dropped on 2026-10-04). Tile rows wrap on desktop and swipe on phones.

### 8.2 What can be added next (pick, then say go)

| Idea | What the visitor sees | What it needs | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Video hero | 6 to 8 second looping clip behind the headline: TV glowing in a living room, AC with cool mist, washing machine drum turning | 2 or 3 clips from Pexels (free licence, commercial use, no attribution), trimmed and saved as small MP4 or WebM in public/img with a poster image | free |
| Living-room banners | Hero and wide banners use lifestyle photos (TV on a wall, AC in a bedroom, washer in a laundry room) instead of studio shots | 3 to 6 images from the Gemini API free tier (about 500 images a day, no card) or Pexels photos | free |
| Product hover video | Hovering a product card plays a 3 second clip (screen lights up, drum spins) | 1 clip per product from the client or Pexels; wait for the real product list | free |
| Category tile videos | The three category tiles play a short loop instead of a still picture | 3 Pexels clips | free |
| Deals countdown | "Ends in 04:12:33" on Deals of the Day | a real end time per deal from the client (admin field); it must not be fake | free |
| 360 degree product view | Drag to spin the product | 12 to 24 photos per product from the client | free once photos exist |
| Gallery cross-fade and zoom | Thumbnails cross-fade; pinch or hover to zoom | more than one photo per product | free |
| Brand logo strip | Logos glide across the page | official logos from the client | free |
| Counters ("2,000+ happy customers") | Numbers count up on scroll | real numbers from the client; never invented | free |
| Smart sticky header | Header shrinks and the logo gets smaller after scrolling | nothing | free |
| Animated logo | The bolt in the logo flashes once on load | the final logo from the client | free |
| Lottie illustrations | Drawn animations (delivery van driving, and so on) | a 60 KB library plus one JSON file per animation, and a CSP change | free but heavier pages |

Client decision (2026-10-04): use free sources (Pexels, Gemini API free tier) rather than paid credits. Phone OTP by SMS is the one thing that is never free (Firebase gives 10 SMS a day free; Twilio only a trial credit).

Rules for video: under 2 MB per clip, muted, looping, with a poster image, and no autoplay on phones with data saver on. Banner copy still follows the marketing copy rule (only claim what the catalogue supports).

## 9. Accessibility

- All images have alt text. Icon-only buttons have labels.
- Everything can be reached and used with the keyboard. Category menus open when their name is reached with Tab and close with Escape.
